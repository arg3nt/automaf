# automaf

AutoMaf is an Electron-based desktop application to help mafia GMs run their games more efficiently.

## Development

To get started developing with AutoMaf, run the `install.sh` script to set up your development environment. To run the UI by itself, navigate to the `automaf-ui` directory and run `npm start`. This gives you live reloading, making development faster. To test out the program in the context of Electron, navigate to the root directory of the repo and run `start.sh`.
